## üöÄ Quick Start & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher
- SharePoint Online tenant with Site Collection Admin rights
- SharePoint App Catalog created (see setup instructions below)
- Microsoft 365 CLI installed and configured:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365
  m365 setup
  ```

### Microsoft 365 CLI Setup (One-time)
Before deployment, ensure the Microsoft 365 CLI is properly configured:

```bash
# Install globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365

# Run setup to configure the CLI
m365 setup

# Login to your Microsoft 365 tenant
m365 login
```

The CLI will guide you through the authentication process. For enterprise environments with MFA, use device code authentication when prompted.

### Installation & Deployment

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
The project includes an interactive setup script that guides you through configuration:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone [repository-url]
cd sp-retro-tool
npm install

# Interactive setup - walks you through tenant configuration
npm run setup

# Build and deploy in one command
npm run deploy:full
```

The `setup` script will:
- Prompt for your SharePoint tenant name
- Ask for admin credentials  
- Generate appropriate URLs automatically
- Create a `.env` file with all configuration
- Validate inputs and provide helpful feedback

#### Option 2: Debug & Diagnose First
Use the built-in diagnostics to check your environment before deployment:

```bash
# Check environment, authentication, and configuration
npm run deploy:debug

# After resolving any issues, proceed with deployment
npm run deploy:sharepoint
```

The debug command provides comprehensive diagnostics:
- Environment validation (Node.js version, CLI availability)
- Package verification (existence, size, modification date)
- Configuration check (all environment variables)
- Authentication status and user information
- App Catalog connectivity test
- Smart recommendations based on current state


#### Option 3: Manual Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone [repository-url]
cd sp-retro-tool
npm install

# Configure environment manually
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your tenant details:
# M365_USERNAME=admin@[your-tenant].onmicrosoft.com
# M365_PASSWORD=your-password
# SHAREPOINT_TENANT_URL=https://[your-tenant].sharepoint.com
# APP_CATALOG_URL=https://[your-tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog

# Build and deploy
npm run deploy:full
```

#### Option 4: Step-by-Step Deployment
```bash
# Build production package
npm run deploy:build

# Deploy to SharePoint (uses credentials from .env)
npm run deploy:sharepoint

# Or do both steps individually:
npm run build:production
npm run package:production
npm run deploy:sharepoint
```

#### Option 5: Manual Upload (Fallback)
If automated deployment fails due to MFA or environment restrictions:

```bash
# Build package
npm run deploy:build

# Manual steps (instructions provided by deploy script):
# 1. Download: sharepoint/solution/sp-retro-tool-webpart.sppkg
# 2. Go to: https://[your-tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog
# 3. Upload to "Apps for SharePoint" library
# 4. Deploy solution tenant-wide
# 5. Add webpart to modern pages
```

#### Option 5: PowerShell Deployment (Windows)
For Windows environments, use the PowerShell script:

```powershell
cd scripts
$SecurePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "YourPassword" -AsPlainText -Force
.\deploy.ps1 -Username "admin@[your-tenant].onmicrosoft.com" -Password $SecurePassword -TenantUrl "https://[your-tenant].sharepoint.com"
```

### App Catalog Setup
If you don't have an App Catalog:

1. Go to SharePoint Admin Center
2. Navigate to **More features** ‚Üí **Apps** ‚Üí **App Catalog**
3. Create new App Catalog site
4. Wait for provisioning (can take 30 minutes)
5. Verify access at `https://[your-tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog`
